# CS201_PROJECT
## PROJECT NAME--Contextual Auto-Fill and Auto-Correct with Learning Memory using Trie Data Structure
## INTRODUCTION:
This project implements an advanced auto-suggestion and auto-correction system using the Trie data structure,
targeting applications that require both word completion and error correction based on user input and historical
usage. The system integrates two Trie trees, A Corpus Trie built from a corpus file, storing words with their
frequencies from the corpus. This file is meant to contain the past writings of the user, which corresponds to
the learning memory aspect of this project, and a Main Trie for storing words typed by the user in real-time,
allowing the system to prioritize suggestions based on recent user behavior.
